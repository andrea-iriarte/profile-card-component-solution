## My process

- Since I decided to build the component using React, my goal was to identify sub-components that the larger design could be broken down into. Even though, I only needed to build one profile card, I wanted to emphasize reusability. Therefore, I created a data file to store the user's data, and then imported that data into the appropriate files, so that I could refer to the information using variables, rather than hardcoding everything in. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- JavaScript

### What I learned

After completing this project, I feel more comfortable positioning elements absolutely.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more programming responsive and resizable 
elements using absolute positioning. 

### Useful resources

- (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15221579/resize-img-using-absolute-positioning) - Helped me with the positioning of the
background elements.
